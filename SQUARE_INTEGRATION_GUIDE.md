# Square Payment Integration Guide
## GI Associates Foundation

This guide explains how to set up and use the Square payment integration for the GI Associates Foundation website.

## Overview

The Square payment integration allows customers to make secure payments for:
- Shop orders (products with "pay what you want" donations)
- One-time donations
- Monthly recurring donations

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
- `/api/square-config.php` - Configuration file for Square credentials
- `/api/square-payment.php` - Main payment processing endpoint
- `/api/square-webhook.php` - Webhook handler for payment updates
- `/src/assets/js/square-payments.js` - Square Web Payments SDK integration
- `/src/css/square-payments-enhanced.css` - Enhanced styling for payment forms

### Files Modified:
- `/src/pages/shop.html` - Added Square payment option alongside Snipcart
- `/src/pages/donations.html` - Replaced placeholder Square integration with real implementation

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Square Credentials

Edit `/api/square-config.php` and replace the placeholder values with your actual Square credentials:

```php
// Replace these with your actual Square sandbox credentials
define('SQUARE_SANDBOX_APP_ID', 'sandbox-sq0idb-xxxxx');
define('SQUARE_SANDBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN', 'sandbox-sq0atb-xxxxx');
define('SQUARE_SANDBOX_LOCATION_ID', 'sandbox-location-id');
```

### 2. Update JavaScript Configuration

Edit `/src/assets/js/square-payments.js` and replace the placeholder Application ID:

```javascript
// Replace with your actual Square Application ID
await window.squarePaymentHandler.initialize('sandbox-sq0idb-xxxxx');
```

### 3. Build the Website

Since you're using Eleventy, run the build command to generate the public files:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will copy the Square integration files from `/src/` to `/public/`.

## Testing

### Sandbox Test Cards

Use these test card numbers for testing:

- **Success:** `4111 1111 1111 1111`
- **Decline:** `4000 0000 0000 0002`
- **CVV:** Any 3 digits
- **Expiry:** Any future date
- **ZIP:** Any valid ZIP code

### Test Scenarios

1. **Shop Order Payment:**
   - Fill out the order form on `/shop/`
   - Click "Pay with Square"
   - Enter test card details
   - Verify payment processing

2. **Donation Payment:**
   - Go to `/donations/`
   - Select an amount and choose "Square" payment method
   - Enter test card details
   - Verify donation processing

## How It Works

### Shop Page Integration

1. User fills out the order form with item details and shipping information
2. User clicks "Pay with Square" button
3. Square payment modal opens with:
   - Order summary
   - Customer information form
   - Secure card payment form
4. User enters card details (handled securely by Square)
5. Payment is processed through Square API
6. Confirmation email is sent to customer and admin

### Donations Page Integration

1. User selects donation amount and chooses "Square" payment method
2. Square payment modal opens with:
   - Donation amount
   - Donor information form
   - Secure card payment form
3. User enters card details and contact information
4. Payment is processed through Square API
5. Donation receipt is sent to donor

## Security Features

- **PCI Compliance:** Square handles all card data securely
- **HTTPS Required:** Square requires SSL certificate
- **API Keys:** Stored securely in configuration file
- **Amount Validation:** Server-side verification
- **Idempotency:** Prevents duplicate charges

## Transaction Logging

All transactions are logged in JSON files:
- `/logs/transactions/` - All payment transactions
- `/logs/orders/` - Shop orders specifically

Log format:
```json
{
  "transaction_id": "txn_1234567890_1234567890",
  "square_payment_id": "sq_payment_123",
  "type": "shop_order",
  "amount": 25.00,
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "customer": {...},
  "items": [...],
  "timestamp": "2025-01-27T20:30:00Z"
}
```

## Email Notifications

The system automatically sends:
- **Order confirmations** to customers
- **Donation receipts** to donors
- **Admin notifications** for all transactions

Email templates are built into the PHP code and can be customized in `/api/square-payment.php`.

## Production Deployment

### 1. Get Production Credentials

1. Log into your Square Dashboard
2. Go to Applications â†’ Your App
3. Get your production credentials:
   - Application ID
   - Access Token
   - Location ID

### 2. Update Configuration

Edit `/api/square-config.php`:

```php
// Update with production credentials
define('SQUARE_PRODUCTION_APP_ID', 'sq0idp-xxxxx');
define('SQUARE_PRODUCTION_ACCESS_TOKEN', 'sq0atp-xxxxx');
define('SQUARE_PRODUCTION_LOCATION_ID', 'location-id');

// Change environment to production
define('SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT', 'production');
```

### 3. Update JavaScript

Edit `/src/assets/js/square-payments.js`:

```javascript
// Update with production Application ID
await window.squarePaymentHandler.initialize('sq0idp-xxxxx');
```

### 4. Test with Real Cards

- Use small amounts first
- Test with your own card
- Monitor transactions in Square Dashboard

## Webhook Setup (Optional)

To receive real-time payment updates:

1. In Square Dashboard, go to Webhooks
2. Add webhook URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/square-webhook.php`
3. Select events: Payment Created, Payment Updated, Refund Created
4. Save webhook configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Square payment system is not available"**
   - Check that Square SDK is loaded
   - Verify Application ID is correct
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Payment fails**
   - Check Square Dashboard for error details
   - Verify API credentials
   - Check server logs

3. **Emails not sending**
   - Check server mail configuration
   - Verify email addresses in config
   - Check spam folders

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by adding to `/api/square-config.php`:

```php
// Add this for debugging
error_reporting(E_ALL);
ini_set('display_errors', 1);
```

## Support

For technical support:
- Check Square Developer Documentation
- Review server error logs
- Test with Square sandbox first
