      "description": "Elegant beaded bracelet with a repeating pattern. The bracelet features a repeating pattern of three distinct bead types. Numerous flat, opaque white disc-shaped beads (heishi beads) form the majority of the bracelet's band. Several translucent, deep red, faceted beads are interspersed. These beads appear to be bicone or barrel-shaped, catching and reflecting light. Small, shiny, metallic gold spherical beads act as spacers, separating the white and red bead sections. The pattern seems to alternate between segments of white disc beads and sections containing red faceted beads flanked by gold spherical beads. This sophisticated piece combines classic white with bold red and warm gold accents. Your donation helps fund our awareness and support programs.",
