      <p class="cs-text">
        G.I. & Associates Foundation is dedicated to helping victims of domestic violence and human 
        trafficking in every way possible. Our mission is simple: to provide comprehensive support 
        that starts with immediate safety and continues through every step of recovery.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        We help men, women, and children regardless of gender, religious belief, or lifestyle. 
        Our process begins by removing victims from dangerous situations, getting them safely housed 
        immediately, and providing all the resources they need from medical care and counseling to 
        legal procedures, protection, and long-term assistance.
